# Week 1 Homework: Code Refactor

## Description

I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor the existing code for the Horiseon landing page to make it more accessible. I was able to improve accessibility by using semantic elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, adding alt attributes to the image files, using a concise, descriptive title element, and properly sequencing the heading attributes. I was also able to improve the code by fixing the Search Engine Optimization link in the nav bar and increasing the efficienct of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties. Each of my changes to the HTML and CSS is noted using a comment.
